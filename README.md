# Pursuit-Core-Web-React-Hooks-Lab

## Tasks
Refactor **two** of the following labs/projects to use hooks. Do not use any class component only functions with `useState` and `useEffect`

1. [React Props Lab: GoFundMe Page](https://github.com/joinpursuit/Pursuit-Core-Web-Props-Lab)
2. [React-Routing-Lab: Fetching Cats and Dogs](https://github.com/joinpursuit/Pursuit-Core-Web-React-Routing-Lab/)
3. [Unit 4 React Assessment](https://github.com/Pursuit-Core-6-2/Pursuit-Core-Web-Unit-4-Assessment)

> 2 & 3 will need `useEffect` to fire side effects (like network requests) or act as a lifecycle method.

## Submission
To submit the two refactored labs just go to the original repo/solution you submitted for the lab in the past, create a branch called `with-hooks` and refactor it in that branch. Make sure to commit and push. Lastly submit the links to your two projects making sure you have selected the `with-hooks` branch on GitHub.
